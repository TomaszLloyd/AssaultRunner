The [instructions providd by Assault Fitness](TSB 14July22_Console_Firmware_Update-1.pdf)

The firmware `.bin` file is [located here](SI3941_DFU_2201061925_V2.7.bin)

## Notes:

- On Step 4 part 4, if you run into issues downloading the bin file and having it show up in the list, I found that I had to upload the bin file to Dropbox, copy a download link, and then it showed up. It was super weird.
